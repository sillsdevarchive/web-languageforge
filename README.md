## Developers ##

We use [Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with two modifications:

- The Gitflow **master** branch is our **live** branch.
- The Gitflow **develop** branch is our **master** branch. All pull requests go against **master**.

We merge from **master** to testing (**qa** branch) then ship from **qa** to **live**.

| Site            | Master Branch | QA Branch | Live Branch |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Language Forge  | `master` | `lf-qa` | `lf-live` |
| Scripture Forge | `master` | `sf-qa` | `sf-live` |

## Style Guides ##

PHP code conforms to [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

- Add `php-cs-fixer` globally installed with *composer* (http://cs.sensiolabs.org/). Here is how to add it to **PhpStorm** (https://hackernoon.com/how-to-configure-phpstorm-to-use-php-cs-fixer-1844991e521f). Use it with the parameters `fix --verbose "$FileDir$/$FileName$"`.

JavaScript code conforms to [AirBNB JS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

- Using PhpStorm with JSCS helps a lot with automating this (see the section below on PhpStorm [Coding Standard and Style](#coding-standard-and-style)).
- We plan to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with pre-commit hook after re-writing the whole repo with Prettier first.

### TypeScript Style Guide ###

Our code base has moved from JavaScript to [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

> Note: this repo is currently AngularJS (1.6) not Angular (2+).

Our TypeScript follows the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide). This is opinionated not only about things like file name conventions but also file and folder structure. This is an appropriate time to change structure and file names since most file contents will be changed anyway. The reason for following this is to make it easier, not only for new developers to the project (like the FLEx team and hired developers) but also to change to Angular (2+) later.

To this end you'll also want to be familiar with [Upgrading from AngularJS](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade) particularly the [Preparation](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade#preparation) section.

We are expecting that TypeScript will help us get things right from the beginning (catching things even as you type) as well as maintenance. We are expecting that it will be an easier transition for the FLEx team and that they will be able to help us with good typing, interfaces and class design.

## Recommended Development Environment ##

### Linux Ubuntu Bionic ###

[Local Linux Development Setup](#local-linux-development-setup). Everything is installed directly on your machine, which needs to be running Ubuntu 18.04. This is the best method because everything runs at full speed.

-------------------------------

### Local Linux Development Setup ###

Start by installing Git and Ansible:
``` shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git ansible
```

Now create a directory for installation and clone the repo:
``` shell
mkdir -p src/xForge
cd src/xForge
git clone https://github.com/sillsdev/web-languageforge --recurse-submodules
```

The `--recurse-submodules` is used to fetch many of the Ansible roles used by the Ansible playbooks in the deploy folder. If you've already cloned the repo without `--recurse-submodules`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull and initialize them.

Run the following Ansible playbook to configure Ansible and run both sites.

```` bash
cd web-languageforge/deploy
ansible-playbook playbook_bionic.yml --limit localhost -K
````

#### Testing the Installation

To build the JavaScript and CSS, run `refreshDeps.sh lf` if you are working on Language Forge, or `refreshDeps.sh sf` if you are working on Scripture Forge. Running `refreshDeps.sh` without arguments defaults to Language Forge.

That's it; you should now be able to open your browser to languageforge.local and scriptureforge.local and log in with the credentials "admin" and "password".

Now would be a good time to check that PHP unit tests, TS unit tests, and E2E tests all work. See the [Testing](#Testing) section below.

#### Building TypeScript and Sass

`refreshDeps.sh` builds the TypeScript and Sass, but it does a lot of other things as well.

To build Sass, run `gulp sass`. To watch the Sass for changes, run `gulp sass:watch`. Pass the `--debug` flag to enable sourcemaps and source comments.

To build TypeScript, run `gulp webpack-lf` or `gulp webpack-sf` to build for Language Forge or Scripture Forge respectively. To watch the files for changes, run `gulp webpack-lf:watch` or `gulp webpack-sf:watch`. This includes a live reload server to refresh the browser on TypeScript changes (browser setup [here](#livereload-chrome-extension)).

#### Language Forge Configuration File ####

If you are working with FLEx Send and Receive feature, manually edit the Language Forge config file

``` bash
sudo gedit /etc/languageforge/conf/sendreceive.conf
```

and modify PhpSourcePath to

``` bash
PhpSourcePath = /var/www/languageforge.org/htdocs
```

-------------------------------

## Installing IDEs and Debugger ##

### Eclipse ###

Install Oracle Java JDK 8

``` bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer oracle-java8-set-default
```

Download the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) installer, extract the tar folder and run the installer.

``` bash
tar xvf eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz
cd eclipse-installer
./eclipse-inst
```

From the installer, select **Eclipse IDE for PHP Developers**

Create a launcher shortcut from your *home* directory

``` bash
gedit .local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop
```

Replacing your *USERNAME*, paste the content below and save

``` bash
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Eclipse
Type=Application
Exec=/home/USERNAME/eclipse/php-neon/eclipse/eclipse
Terminal=false
Icon=/home/USERNAME/eclipse/php-neon/eclipse/icon.xpm
Comment=Integrated Development Environment
NoDisplay=false
Categories=Development;IDE;
Name[en]=Eclipse
```

Even though we no longer use Eclipse for web development, we [install](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/monjadb) the MonjaDB plugin for browsing and updating MongoDB.

Once the MonjaDB plugin is installed, access `MonjaDB` from the Eclipse menu and select `Connect`. Set the database name to `scriptureforge` (both sites use the same database). Keep the other default settings and click `OK` and you should see the contents of the database.

### PhpStorm ###

Download [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/#section=linux-version), extract the tar file and install.  You may need to modify newer version numbers accordingly...

``` bash
tar xvf PhpStorm-2016.2.1.tar.gz
sudo mv PhpStorm-162.1889.1/  /opt/phpstorm
sudo ln -s /opt/phpstorm/bin/phpstorm.sh /usr/local/bin/phpstorm
# launch
phpstorm
```

LSDev members can contact their team lead to get the SIL license information.  PhpStorm also has an option *Evaluate for free for 30 days*.

#### Coding Standard and Style ####

[Download](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294) the PhpStorm plugin for EditorConfig and then install:

**File** --> **Settings** --> **Plugins** --> **Install plugin from disk**

This uses the `.editorconfig` file at the root folder to enforce coding standards.

Also enable JSCS:

**File** -> **Settings** -> **Languages & Frameworks** -> **JavaScript** --> **Code Quality Tools**  --> **JSCS**

Set the *Enable* checkbox
Set *Node interpreter* to `usr/local/bin/node`
Set *JSCS package* to `/usr/local/bin/jscs`
Set *Search for config(s)* radio button to `.jscsrc or .jscs.json`
Set the *Code style preset* dropdown to `Airbnb`

Modify `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/jscs/presets/airbnb.json` and change `"requireTrailingComma": { "ignoreSingleLine": true }` to
`"disallowTrailingComma": true,`

#### Creating the PhpStorm Project ####

Launch PhpStorm.

Click **Create New Project from Existing Files**. Leave the default option (Web server is installed locally, source files are located under its document root) and click **Next**.

 From the **Create New Project: Choose Project Directory** dialog,  browse to the `web-languageforge` directory, then mark it as **Project Root** (using the `Project Root` button in the toolbar) and click **Next**.

From the **Add Local Server** dialog set
Name: `languageforge.local`
Web server root URL: `http://languageforge.local`
--> **Next** --> **Finish**

### Xdebug ###

The Ansible script should automatically install and configure php-xdebug for you. If using VS Code, a debug extension is included in the recommended extensions to install for this project.

#### Integrating Xdebug with PhpStorm ####

Setting *PHP Interpreter* from PhpStorm

**File** --> **Settings** --> **Languages & Frameworks** --> **PHP**

From the dropdown to *PHP language level*, select `"7"`
For *Interpreter*, click `"..."` to browse, then `"+"`

- Name: PHP 7
- PHP executable: /usr/bin/php

Adding *Servers* from PhpStorm

**File** --> **Settings** --> **Languages & Frameworks** --> **PHP** --> **Servers**
Click the "+" to add the following Name & Hosts:

- default.local
- languageforge.local
- scriptureforge.local

Restart apache2

``` bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

#### Xdebug helper Chrome extension ####

Install the [Xdebug helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) extension which adds a bug icon to the top right area of Chrome extensions.

Right-click to select **Options** and set **IDE key**

- PhpStorm PHPSTORM

When it's time to Debug, check that the bug icon is green for **Debug**.

Then, from PhpStorm, click the telephone icon near the top right for *Start Listening for PHP Connections*.

Reference for [Integrating Xdebug with PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/2016.2/configuring-xdebug.html#integrationWithProduct).

### LiveReload ###

#### LiveReload Chrome extension ####

Install the [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en-US) extension.

Then from PhpStorm, click
**View**->**Tool Windows** -> **Gulp**

When you want LiveReload running, double-click the **reload** or **build-webpack:watch** Gulp task.
Then in the LiveReload chrome extension, click to enable it.  A solid dot in the circle means the plugin is connected. Now when an applicable source file is changed and saved, it should trigger an automate page reload in the browser.

### Visual Studio Code ###

Visual Studio Code is a simple, free, cross-platform code editor. You can download VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The first time you open VS Code in the `web-languageforge` directory, it will recommend a list of extensions that are useful for developing **xForge** apps.

Build tasks have been setup to work on both and Linux. Tasks are available for performing webpack build, sass build, and npm install. Tasks are defined in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file.

Chrome debugging has also been configured. Launch configurations are defined in the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

## Testing ##

### PHP Unit Tests ###

Unit testing currently uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) which was already installed by composer. To run them use `gulp test-php`.

#### Integrating PHPUnit with PhpStorm ####

**File** -> **Settings** -> **Languages & Frameworks** -> **PHP** -> **PHPUnit**

Under PHPUnit Library, select `Use Composer autoloader` option
For `Path to script` browse to `web-languageforge/src/vendor/autoload.php`

Under Test Runner
Select *Default configuration file* and browse to `web-languageforge/test/php/phpunit.xml`

Select *Default boostrap file* and browse to `web-languageforge/test/php/TestConfig.php`

To run tests, browse to the project view, right-click `test/php` and select `Run php`.

Note: at least one test will fail if the LFMerge (send/receive) program is not installed and available.  This is OK as long as you are not testing Send/Receive functionality.

### TypeScript Unit Tests ###

`gulp test-ts-lf` or `gulp test-ts-sf`

If you are doing a lot of testing use

`gulp test-ts-lf:watch` or `gulp test-ts-sf:watch`

TypeScript unit test spec files live in the `src` folder next to the relevant source file and have the file extension `.spec.ts`. Only E2E test specs will be in the `test` folder.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests ###

E2E tests live in the `test` folder and have the file extension `.e2e-spec.ts`.

#### Install/Update Webdriver ####

From the `web-languageforge` directory

``` bash
npm install
gulp test-e2e-webdriver_update
```

#### E2E Test Run ####

From the *web-languageforge* directory, start **webdriver** in one terminal:

```` bash
gulp test-e2e-webdriver_standalone
````

Then to run **languageforge** tests in another terminal:

```` bash
./rune2e.sh lf
````

To run **scriptureforge** tests:

``` bash
./rune2e.sh sf
```

(If you get an error messages like `Error: ECONNREFUSED connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4444` you probably forgot to start the **webdriver**, see above)

To test a certain test spec, add a parameter `--specs [spec name]`.  For example,

``` bash
./rune2e.sh lf --specs lexicon-new-project
```

will run the the *lexicon-new-project.e2e-spec.ts* tests on **languageforge**.

To debug the tests:
- Do at least one of the following:
  * If you are going to debug in VSCode, place breakpoints in the tests.
  * Place breakpoints in your code (`debugger;` statements).
  * To pause the debugger on the first test failure, go to `test/app/protractorConf.js` and uncomment the line that adds the `pauseOnFailure` reporter.
- Start the tests with `./rune2e.sh`. Wait for the tests to actually start running before moving to the next steps.
- To debug in Chrome, go to `chrome://inspect/#devices`. Under "Remote Target" click to inspect the Node.js process.
- To debug in VSCode, select the "Node debugger" debug configuration and run it.

Unfortunately, debugging the e2e tests does not currently work very well because of the way WebDriver handles control flow.

## Get a copy of the live database ##

You need to have SSH access to the live database on [Language Forge](https://languageforge.org) or [Scripture Forge](https://scriptureforge.org).

(For installation of npm see https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)

Install gulp dependencies by running from the repo root (where):

    npm install

To install the mongodb databases locally, run:

``` bash
gulp mongodb-copy-prod-db
```

## Resetting MongoDB ##

If you want to _start over_ with your mongo database, you can use the factory reset script like so (this will delete all data in the mongodb):

```` bash
cd scripts/tools
./FactoryReset.php run
````

After a fresh factory reset, there is one user.  username: admin password: password

## Updating dependencies ##

Occasionally developers need to update composer or npm.  If something isn't working after a recent code change, try to update the dependencies using `./refreshDeps.sh lf` or `./refreshDeps sf`. If you know what has changed you can manually run some of the steps below.

### Update npm packages ###

In the *root* folder: `npm install`

### Update composer ###

In the **src/** folder: `composer install`
